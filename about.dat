	This is a project work made in C++ Programming language.  This project would not have been possible without the help 
	of our respected teachers, Siddhartha Kayastha and Navin Prasai. BANK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM as the name suggests 
	records and stores personal as well as financial details of customers. This program includes variety of options: create a/c,
	check a/c, deposit, withdraw, transfer between existing a/cs, close an a/c, list all registered a/c. We used seekp and seekg
	pointers to modify data, resulting in faster execution. Only closing an account use a second file.
